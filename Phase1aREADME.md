# ENG_EC_601
This is for phase 1a of project 2 for ENG EC 601

Unfortunately I was unable to successfully get my API code to run. The tutorials that are available for creating an API are not very intuitive, and after spending several hours struggling I decided to play around with APIs that were available in the API playground. Under the code section for phase 1a I have some code that I wrote, but I am still stuck on the part where I try to get it to authenticate so I can actually run the functions I wrote.
